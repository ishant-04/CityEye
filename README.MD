<h1>Geo-Tagging System of CCTV Cameras for Centralized Surveillance <h1/>


Centralized Camera Management System Overview This project aims to create a centralized web portal that acts as a hub for managing privately owned cameras. It provides a single point of access to all functionalities related to camera registration, access to real-time footage, standardized data collection, and more.

Features Centralized Portal Creating a web portal to offer a unified access point to all project functionalities.

Camera Registration and Licensing Handling registration for privately owned cameras, ensuring they are voluntarily provided and licensed appropriately.

Interactive Map An interactive map displays all geo-tagged cameras, providing easy access and information about their locations.

Real-time Footage Retrieval Authorized individuals can quickly retrieve real-time footage from selected cameras through the portal.

Standardized Data Collection Implementing fixed standards for data and metadata collection, simplifying data stream maintenance and storage.

Owner Contact Information Enabling easy access to camera data along with options to quickly contact the owner, facilitating faster response in policing.

Real-time Image Processing Implementing image processing algorithms for automated object identification, aiding quick analysis of camera feeds.

Threat Alerts Running real-time algorithms to identify and alert potential threats for appropriate action.

Camera and Footage Health Check Monitoring camera health and notifying owners in case of required repairs or maintenance.

Interdisciplinary Approach The project involves various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning, making it a challenging task suitable for hackathons and collaborative development.
